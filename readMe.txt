This is an application that automatically checks you into app academy. This is to ONLY be used to help you not forget and is NOT to be used to simulate being present.

To run:
NPM install. Then open the index.js file to add your username and password for github (this is how app academy checks you in).
Finally, decide if you want the program to run in headless mode:
Pros of headless: Will not have the annoying popup.
Cons: Can only know it ran via looking at the console.
